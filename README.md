# DevBoard

**DevBoard** is an offline-first project management and task tracking app built specifically for developers and programming workflows.

Inspired by tools like **Notion** and **Obsidian**, DevBoard focuses on clarity, speed, and local control—without subscriptions, heavy memory usage, or cloud dependency.

It is designed for **solo developers** who want a powerful way to manage coding projects, features, bugs, and technical notes in one place.
